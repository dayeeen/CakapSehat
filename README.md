# CakapSehat

## Description
One of the main concerns underlying this project is the lack of awareness in society about mental health, especially in the midst of bullying cases that continue to emerge every year. CakapSehat aims to address this issue by providing access to mental health consultation and support in the form of a chatbot accompanied by relevant verses from the Quran (optional). This application is based on two main Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): health and inequality. The algorithms to be used in the development process of this application include NLP (BERT) and LSTM.
